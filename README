== What is RubyPong?

RubyPong is a simple Pong clone, with a few additions in color, game speeds,
music, and settings screens. It's based on the tutorial by Tyler J Church at
ManWithCode.com, with some changes, additions and tweaks by yours truly. It's
built in Ruby, and runs on the Rubygame gem.

== Requirements

Until I create an installer for this game, you'll need to install:

* Ruby = 1.9.3, 2.0.0 (this is what I've tested, it make work with other versions)
* Rubygame = 2.6.4
* Ruby-sdl-ffi gem, found at https://github.com/xrs1133/ruby-sdl-ffi

If you have RVM, you can simply do:

 $ cd rubyGame
 $ rvm install 2.0.0
 $ rvm use 2.0.0@rubygame --create
 $ gem install bundler
 $ bundle install

== Running the Game

 $ ruby ruby-pong.rb
